        "description": "No one is infallible, not our heroes, not our leaders, not even those who pioneered for the preservation of the natural world. President Theodore Roosevelt left a complex legacy. While he helped to create the National Park Service and set out to protect and preserve public lands, he excluded Indigenous voices. What would it be like to sit down and talk with Teddy today? â€”What would you ask him? In this episode, park visitors share how they respond to this multifaceted human and the legacy he left behind.",
